# pybleno
[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pybleno)](https://pepy.tech/project/pybleno)

A direct port of the Bleno bluetooth LE peripheral role library to Python2/3

The logic of this library was originally written by Sandeep Mistry (https://github.com/sandeepmistry/bleno),
and this repository is a direct port of that code-base. A huge thanks to Sandeep for his solid library.

The python code has been generated by a customer transpiler - ensuring that code follows a consistent convention.
It also ensures functional parity between Bleno on Nodejs, and Pybleno on Python.

__Note:__ Currently only tested on Linux Raspbian

## Prerequisites
Please read the [original nodejs Bleno prerequisites](https://github.com/noble/bleno#prerequisites), failure to meet these may result in 'Operation not permitted' errors at runtime.

## Install

```sh
pip install pybleno
```

## Usage

```python
from pybleno import *

bleno = Bleno()
```

See [examples folder](https://github.com/Adam-Langley/pybleno/blob/master/bleno/examples) for code examples.

See the original nodejs Bleno documentation for usage.

## Running the Examples

If you don't have Pybleno 'installed' - then from within the pybleno folder:

```
sudo python3 -m bleno.examples.echo.main
```

## Troubleshooting
 * Symptoms: Peripheral stops responding, notifications not going through - pi must be rebooted. Kernel log contains `hci0: Frame reassembly failed`
   * Cause: Bugs in bluetooth kernel module - manifests whe running Raspbian <= 2018-11-13. 
   * Fix: `apt-get upgrade`

## Transpiler Goals

1. Mirror the following attributes of the origin code
   - file/folder structure and naming
   - order
   - formatting
   - naming conventions
   - inline comments
   - whitespace
   - usage
2. Utilise first class pythonic features without compromising on 'mirroring' goals
    - where language deviates too much, supplement capabilities through supporting modules
3. Maintability over runtime optimization

## Coding Conventions

Files/Folders:

bleno/supporting/ : location of all supplemental files, which allow the transpiled code to parallel the node source as reasonably as possible.
_file.py : underscored filenames denote a hand-crafted file, vs a transpiled output.

Import/Require:
TODO: Explain differences here

Expanding Lists and KV objects:

Resilience to Superfluous Function Arguments:
*varargs

Default Args:

For Loops:
Python doesnt support `for` loop expressions, these are approximated through unbounded whiles, with a terminator case.

Switch Cases:
Python doesn't support switch expressions, these are approximated with a helper function. Fallthrough is calculated by the transpiler, and achieved by multi-conditional comparison.
